# Proposition: Learners remember with analogies and cues

Use appropriate emphasis on story grammars and text structures is a concern to distinguish these from the use of metaphor in explanation.

This includes verbal cues and their development into narratives, the use of concept maps, comparative organisers, case examples, & etc. Must be combined however with integrated and structured knowledge (see content.md)

However, be careful with potential confusion between connotative and denotative knowledge.
