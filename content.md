# Proposition: Learners construct knowledge

Structural knowledge is achieved when knowledge exists in an embedded organised structure with other knowledge, and can be built to acquire further knowledge, distinct from rote and recognition knowledge.

Structured knowledge is what distinguishes the novice from the expert, because they have "deep knowledge" (i.e., that which is integrated) isn't stratching around on "surface features of a problem or bits of information".

Do not introduce new content to a subject before the pre-requisite content has been understood.
