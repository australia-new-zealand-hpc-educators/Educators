# Proposition: There is a continuum between andragogy and pedagogy

* Adult learners have a greater equality of power with the educator, and delivery must be orientated in this manner.
* Adult learners have greater intrinsic motivation, compared to extrinsic requirements; they don't have to attend the class, they *want* to attend the class.
* Adult learners have a greater personal experience as a learning resource. Content should be orientated towards *their* particular problems. In many areas they have *greater* knowledge than the educator.
* Adult learners have a greater research orientation, rather than teacher-training orientation.
* Ties with developmental psychology (Piaget, Mead, Kohlberg) for cognitive, role, and moral reasoning.  Stabilisation of brain plasticity from myelination of the prefrontox cortex and the pruning of synatic clusters by the mid-twenties, *on average*.
